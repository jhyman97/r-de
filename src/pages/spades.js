                    <h3>Step 1: Bidding</h3>
                    <p>At the start of the round, players bid on number of tricks they think they could possibly win. Total bid determines goal of each round.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Playing Tricks</h3>
                    <p>Player who leads the trick plays a card from hand. Others will follow suit if they can. Highest card in suit wins the trick unless a spade is played which trumps other suits.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Scoring</h3>
                    <p>At the end of round, teams are awarded points based on number of tricks they won. Failing to meet the bid will result in penalties and extra tricks</p>
