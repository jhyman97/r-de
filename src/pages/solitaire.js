            <ul>
                <li>The goal is to move all cards to be the foundation piles, sorted by suit and in ascending order.</li>
                <li>Cards in the tableau can be arranged in order by going down, alternating red and black cards.</li>
                <li>Can move sequences of cards or individual cards between columns, but only a king can go in an empty place.</li>
                <li>You can draw cards from the stockpile, which can either be turned one at a time or three depending on style of play.</li>

                    <h3>Step 1: Set up the game</h3>
                    <p>Game begins with 7 piles, draw a card from the stockpile to reveal additional cards. Keep playing until all piles/columns are done or you cannot make a move</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Move The Cards</h3>
                    <p>Look for sequences of cards that can be arranged in different ways. Can also move into foundation pile if they are in sequence.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Use the stockpile</h3>
                    <p>If no moves can be made, draw from stockpile. Keep going until you cannot any more.</p>

                    <h3>1. Expose hidden cards early</h3>
                    <p>When possible prioritize moves that expose hidden cards. This allows more moves to be possible and increases chances of winning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>2. Build Foundations Evenly</h3>
                    <p>Try to build all foundations evenly instead of trying to complete just one. Helps keep more cards in play and opens up more options.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tip">
                    <h3>3. Don't Empty Columns Early</h3>
                    <p>Hold off on moving cards to an empty space unless it is a king then go ahead. Empty spaces are more valuable if you can move large sequences.</p>
