            <ul>
                <li>The goal is to have a hand value closest to 21, without going over 21.</li>
                <li>Each player is dealt two cards. Cards 2-10 are face value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces can be 1 or 11.</li>
                <li>Players can "hit" to recieve another card or "stand" to keep their hand as it is.</li>
                <li>If your hand exceeds 21 you bust.</li>
                <li>Dealer must hit if hand is below 16 and stand if 17 or above</li>
                <li>If dealer and player end up with the same values, they "push" which is a split</li>
            </ul>
