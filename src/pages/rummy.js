                    <h3>Step 1: Deal the cards</h3>
                    <p>Each player recieves a hand of cards, typically 10 for two players or 7 for more. The remaining cards form the draw pile.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Take Turns Drawing and Discarding</h3>
                    <p>On each turn, a player draws a card from the draw pile or the discard pile and discards one card.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Form Sets and Sequences</h3>
                    <p>Try to arrange your cards into valid sets or sequnces. A set is 3 or 4 cards of the same rank, while a sequence is 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Declare "Rummy"</h3>
                    <p>Once you have formed valid sets or sequences with all your cards, declare "Rummy" to end the round. Score the round based on remaining ungrouped cards of other players.</p>
